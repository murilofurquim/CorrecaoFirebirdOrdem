# The pre install routine for Firebird Classic



#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Check for installed RPM package

# (Pavel I've left this in since originally I could test for other packages,
# even if they did not conflict with current ones, ie we can test InterBase
# and CS/SS  The package manager does not allow it currently but I've left
# this in in case that sort of thing gets allowed again

#checkForRPMInstall() {
#    PackageName=$1
#
#    rpm -q $PackageName
#    STATUS=$? 
#    if [ $STATUS -eq 0 ]
#      then 
#        echo "Previous version of $PackageName is detected on your system." 
#        echo "this will conflict with the current install of Firebird"
#        echo "Please unistall the previous version `rpm -q $PackageName` and then proceed." 
#        exit $STATUS 
#    fi 
#
#}



#= Main Pre ================================================================

# Ok so any of the following packages are a problem
# these don't work at least in the latest rpm manager, since it 
# has the rpm database locked and it fails.

#    checkForRPMInstall InterBase
#    checkForRPMInstall FirebirdCS
#    checkForRPMInstall FirebirdSS


    checkIfServerRunning

# Failing that we archive any files we find

    archivePriorInstallSystemFiles
