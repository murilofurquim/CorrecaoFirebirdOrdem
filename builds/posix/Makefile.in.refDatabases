# able to be started, $INTERBASE variable pointing in the wrong place, 
# shared library path LD_LIBRARY_PATH not pointing to new stuff (mind you this
# point it should be creating using create_db statically linked). 
# Also you don't need to worry about lock mgr not being able to set uid to
# superuser.  You do not have to be root to build classic, it's just a warning
# and the build process works fine.
