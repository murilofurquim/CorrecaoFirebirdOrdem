        Distinct with blob fields
      Contributor(s):
        Dmitry Yemanov <dimitr at firebirdsql.org>
      Note(s):
        This change restores the legacy behavior of DISTINCT / UNION / GROUP BY and ORDER BY operations.
        Please beware that they may produce incorrect result set, because the ordering / distinct
        is performed using blob IDs instead of the blob contents.
        It implies that changes CORE-859 and CORE-1530 are rolled back.
